DiffEqNoiseProcess.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem.
It holds the tools for developing noise processes for differential equations.
While completely independent and usable on its own, users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl).
